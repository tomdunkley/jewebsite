## Info
The files for the June Event website

I was the IT/Ticketing Officer for the 2021 Sidney Sussex June Event. The event was ultimately cancelled due to covid.

The website I developed is archived here and also on my website, at https://tomdunkley.co.uk/projects.

There are two versions of the website, one which was an interactive puzzle where students could guess the theme of the event to get free tickets. The second was available after the theme was revealed.

If you want to play along, the theme is the first thing that comes up when you go to the second version (https://tomdunkley.co.uk/projects/je-website/juneeventfinalactual/)
